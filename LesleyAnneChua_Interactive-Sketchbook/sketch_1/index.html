        <h1>Tiring/Tired</h1>
        <script src="js/p5Sketch.js"></script>
        <p>This sketch represents "tiring" by showing how I feel when I start the day tired; it feels like I can't get up in the mornings and I have <i>low</i> energy throughout the day. This is shown using <b>constraints</b>, which keep the cursor-controlled rectangle (representing me) from moving up past a certain point in the canvas rectangle (the day).</p>
