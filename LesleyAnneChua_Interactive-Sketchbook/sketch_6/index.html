        <h1>New "Else" Sketch</h1>
        <script src="js/p5-sketch-6.js"></script>
        <p>I designed this sketch based on the "if/else" system idea that my group mates came up with on Thursday: boarding a bus. I made the rule that you can "board the bus" (get a success message) if you press down the space bar while the bus is on the green area of the canvas.</p>
        <p>The sketch includes a bus you can directly manipulate to move back and forth through the canvas and green area. If you press SPACE while the bus is not on the green area (the "else" statement), you get an error message. The users know a state has changed via the success and error messages that appear.</p>
