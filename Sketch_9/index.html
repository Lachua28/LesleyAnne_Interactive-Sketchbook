        <ol>
            <li>I find most things easier when they can be broken down into smaller, digestible parts, so modularizing the code helped me understand all the functions a little more.</li>
            <li>I added the new behaviour of displaying "Frogbert" text when the spacebar is pressed on the second image. I also added another array that changes the background colour with each image.</li>
            <li>This sketch communicates state more clearly with the text we learned in class that shows a number for which image is currently displayed.</li>
            <li>I'd say the switch between images feels more intentional because the text now implies there are multiple images and says how to flip through them.</li>
