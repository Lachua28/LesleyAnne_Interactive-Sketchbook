        <h1>Eat with "else"</h1>
        <script src="js/p5-sketch-5.js"></script>
        <p>The rule I designed is around key pressing. The original "if" statement is that, once the max steps are reached, you can reset the sketch by pressing the space bar. I added an "else" statement where, if any key other than the space bar is pressed, an 'error' message appears instead of resetting the sketch.</p>
        <p>The "otherwise" that happens is that a sassy error message shows up and the filled up canvas changes colours. These visual cues are also how the user knows the state has changed, albeit temporarily and only for as long as a wrong key is pressed.</p>
