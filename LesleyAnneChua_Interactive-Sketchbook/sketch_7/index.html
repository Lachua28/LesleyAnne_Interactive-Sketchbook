        <p>The inequities in this sketch are the variables "grey" and "rColour" which cycle through values between 0–255 and 0–1 respectively. After a click, the system adds a section to the top rectangle with a grey value between 0–255. The bottom rectangle adds a green section if "rColour" is found to be more than 0.5. Otherwise, the new section is red. (I forgot how to do the true/false code when I did this sketch and it was before the Zoom recording was posted, so this was my workaround.)</p>
        <p>I guess this isn't the best sketch to show it, but accumulation over time show the inequity by not having a square show up at certain points. Lastly, I learned and struggled a lot with the true/false workaround while making this.</p>
