        <h2>3. Written Clarification</h2>
        <p><b>What is the core rule of this system?:</b> The core rule of this system is that you can board the bus (success) when the bus reaches a certain point—the bus stop. If you attempt to board the bus when it's not at the stop, you don't board the bus (fail).</p>
        <p><b>What changes over time?:</b> The bus moves across the road towards the stop over time, if this is something we learn in class or I can learn myself. If I can't learn to automate the movement, I would put choices for each stop (the "try to board the bus" and "wait" options shown in the flow chart image).</p>
        <p><b>Where does the system become uneven?:</b> You don't get the 'success' ending (board the bus) unless the bus is at the stop, so you'll get a negative response if you try to board early or late.</p>
        <p><b>Why is this idea worth developing further?:</b> I'm interested in developing this idea further because I think it's a relatable experience that can be made into a fun interactive system. I also think it's a good opportunity to learn how to automate movement over time, which is something I haven't done before but would like to learn. Additionally, I think coding the three different endings (too early, successful boarding, and missed the bus) will provide a good challenge and allow for some creative storytelling. Lastly, since I've already figured out how to make a bus shape, I'd like to use that again in this project.</p>
