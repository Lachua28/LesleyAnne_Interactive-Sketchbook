        <p>This sketch shows "cold" by representing 'snow' (the white ellipses) covering the dirt ground over time in the winter (the brown background). I used <b>direct manipulation</b> and <b>accumulation</b> to mimic snow falling on the ground and staying there, building up on top of each other until the ground is white.</p>
