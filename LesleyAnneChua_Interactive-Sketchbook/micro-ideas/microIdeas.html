        <h2>Waiting for the Bus</h2>
        <p><b>Issue:</b> After waiting for the bus, you either get on or miss the bus.</p>
        <p><b>Interaction rule:</b> The input would be pressing a button to board the bus when the bus is at a specific point/stop. The change over time is the bus moving and reaching then passing a bus stop; I would like to use automated movement over time if we learn that! The delay would be waiting for the bus to reach a certain point.</p>
        <p><b>Intended feeling:</b> Waiting & anticipation</p>

        <h2>"Some people have it easy, others have to work hard"</h2>
        <p><b>System:</b> You get a reward for clicking a certain amount of times.</p>
        <p><b>Interaction rule:</b> The input is clicks or button presses. The change over time would be some sort of meter going up, but a random determination at the start requires you to either need a lot or a little amount of clicks to fill the meter. Friction appears in the beginning where its determined whether you need to click more than the "easy" path.</p>
        <p><b>Intended feeling:</b> frustration and privilege, depending on your luck</p>

        <h2>Growing a Plant</h2>
        <p><b>Behaviour:</b> You grow a plant over time by doing a certain action over time.</p>
        <p><b>Interaction rule:</b> The input will either be a click/press on at least 2 different buttons. The change over time is the plant growing. The limit or uneveness would either be that each action only grows the plant until a certain point, or that you have to wait for the plant to grow.</p>
        <p><b>Intended feeling:</b> waiting/patience</p>
