        <h1>Eat</h1>
        <script src="js/p5Sketch.js"></script>
        <p>I have updated my third sketch to now demonstrate the verb "eat." In my initial sketch, the code represented "hungry" by filling the canvas after a click to simulate eating, so I improved the code to do the same action but with more increments with each mouse click.</p>
        <p>This is done by adding a rule that changes the size of the rectangle <i>each time</i> mouse is pressed, rather than just once (which is what I had before).</p>
        <p><b>The new thing I learned from the reading was easing.</b> To use it, I added a direct manipulation circle that follows the mouse. It doesn't have anything to do with eating and the easing itself doesn't affect the previous behaviour of the sketch, but I wanted it to be a fun reveal as you "eat." <b>I also learned about "keyIsPressed"</b> from an external reading, which affects the behaviour by resetting the sketch after pressing the spacebar.</p>
